	<h2>Excersie is very important</h2>

	<p>Remeber diet is not the only thing needed to stay in shape, excercise is equally if not more 
important. It is recommended to get at least 30 minutes of active movement in every day. For the best 
results if trying to lose weight, cardio is the most effective method. For keeping tone, small weights and 
core workouts are good.

	"I'm young; I'm handsome; I'm fast. I can't possibly be beat."
	"Don’t count the days; make the days count."
	“If my mind can conceive it, and my heart can believe it—then I can achieve it." Jesse Jackson said this as early as 1983, according to the Associated Press, and Ali used it in his 2004 book.
