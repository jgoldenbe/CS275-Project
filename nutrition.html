			<h2>Things you need to know about nutrition</h2>
			<p><h3>Definition</h3>
			 Nutrition is the supply of materials - food that provide energy for the body, required by organisms and cells to stay alive. There are two main nutrition: Macro nutrient and Micro nutrient. </p>
			
			<p>As molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics advance, nutrition has become more focused on metabolism and metabolic pathways - biochemical steps through which substances inside us are transformed from one form to another.

			Nutrition also focuses on how diseases, conditions, and problems can be prevented or reduced with a healthy diet.
			To build a healthy body you must combine healthy eating and physical activities.</p>
			
			<p>Macronutrients are eaten in large amounts and include the primary building blocks of your diet — protein, carbohydrates, and fat — which provide your body with energy.</p>
			<p>The human body requires seven major types of nutrients:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>1.Protein</li>
			Protein provides the building blocks of the body, and not just for muscle. Every cell, from bone to skin to hair, contains protein.
			<li>2.Carbonhydrates</li>
			Carbs fuel your body, especially your central nervous system and brain, and protect against disease
			<li>3.Fats</li>
			fat supports many of your body’s functions such as vitamin and mineral absorption, blood clotting, building cells, and muscle movement.
			<li>4.Vitamins</li>
			Vitamins are vital for warding off disease and staying healthy. The body needs these micronutrients to support its functions. There are 13 essential vitamins that the body needs to function properly, including vitamins A, C, B6, and D.
			<li>5.Minerals</li>
			Minerals responsible for building strong bones and teeth, regulating your metabolism, and staying properly hydrated. Some of the most common minerals are calcium, iron, and zinc.
			<li>6.Water</li>
			Water improves your brain function and mood. It acts a shock absorber and a lubricant in the body. It also helps flush out toxins, carry nutrients to cells, hydrate the body, and prevent constipation.
			<li>7. Fiber</li>
			Fiber, also known as roughage, is the indigestible part of plant foods that travels through our digestive system, absorbing water along the way and easing bowel movements.
